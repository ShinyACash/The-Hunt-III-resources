# The-Hunt-III-resources

Okay i need sleep, desperately. I need to do homework, study, play games, read konosuba (when will june 22 come?), write my light novel -sigh-
I wish i had a friend who knew javascript (glares at dan) and could help me with the coding cuz it's kinda grindy. 

Anyway, i need to run down all the necessary resources i need for this....
//my brain can't think of anything-
