# The-Hunt-III-resources

Okay i need sleep, desperately. I need to do homework, study, play games, read konosuba (when will june 22 come?), write my light novel -sigh-
I wish i had a friend who knew javascript (glares at dan) and could help me with the coding cuz it's kinda grindy. 

Anyway, i need to run down all the necessary resources i need for this....
//my brain can't think of anything-

ummm les see...


#Code hints (includes fake codes as well)

`Little birds can remember`

`name of the waifu i really want`

`pyroxene crystal?`

`Look aroun github.`

`my name? non.`

`All hints so far were fake` //i mean that would just be mean at this point

`file names? kinda hard for them...` //welp i AM giving them a free 90% off coupon- anyway. -sigh-
